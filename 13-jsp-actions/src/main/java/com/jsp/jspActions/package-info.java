/*
 * JSP actions, often referred to as JSP action tags, are special XML-like tags
 * used in JavaServer Pages (JSP) to perform various tasks and operations within
 * a JSP page. JSP actions provide a way to modularize and simplify the
 * development of dynamic web applications by encapsulating common
 * functionality. Here are some commonly used JSP action tags:
 * 
 * 1. **`<jsp:include>` Action:** This action is used to include the content of
 * another resource (usually another JSP or HTML file) within the current JSP
 * page at the time of request processing. It allows for modularization and
 * reuse of code.
 * 
 * ```jsp <jsp:include page="header.jsp" /> ```
 * 
 * 2. **`<jsp:forward>` Action:** The `<jsp:forward>` action is used to forward
 * the current request to another JSP page or servlet. It is often used for
 * control flow within a web application.
 * 
 * ```jsp <jsp:forward page="anotherPage.jsp" /> ```
 * 
 * 3. **`<jsp:param>` Action:** When used in conjunction with `<jsp:forward>`,
 * `<jsp:param>` allows you to pass parameters to the target resource (JSP or
 * servlet) during a forward.
 * 
 * ```jsp <jsp:forward page="targetPage.jsp"> <jsp:param name="paramName"
 * value="paramValue" /> </jsp:forward> ```
 * 
 * 4. **`<jsp:useBean>` Action:** This action is used to create or reference
 * JavaBeans within a JSP page. JavaBeans are reusable Java components that
 * encapsulate data and methods.
 * 
 * ```jsp <jsp:useBean id="user" class="com.example.User" scope="session" /> ```
 * 
 * 5. **`<jsp:setProperty>` and `<jsp:getProperty>` Actions:** These actions are
 * used to set and get properties of JavaBeans, allowing you to interact with
 * JavaBean components.
 * 
 * ```jsp <jsp:setProperty name="user" property="name" value="John" />
 * <jsp:getProperty name="user" property="name" /> ```
 * 
 * 6. **`<jsp:plugin>` Action:** The `<jsp:plugin>` action is used to embed
 * browser-specific HTML code for browser plugins, such as Java applets or Flash
 * objects.
 * 
 * ```jsp <jsp:plugin type="applet" code="MyApplet" codebase="applets/"
 * width="300" height="200"> <!-- Parameters for the applet --> <jsp:params>
 * <jsp:param name="param1" value="value1" /> <jsp:param name="param2"
 * value="value2" /> </jsp:params> </jsp:plugin> ```
 * 
 * 7. **Custom Tag Actions:** Developers can define their own custom tags using
 * tag libraries (Taglibs) and use them within JSP pages. Custom tag actions
 * allow for the creation of reusable and domain-specific functionality.
 * 
 * ```jsp <my:customTag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2" /> ```
 * 
 * These JSP action tags provide a powerful way to encapsulate and modularize
 * functionality in JSP pages, making it easier to build dynamic web
 * applications. They promote code reusability, separation of concerns, and
 * improved maintainability of web applications. Custom tag libraries, in
 * particular, enable developers to extend JSP functionality to meet specific
 * project requirements.
