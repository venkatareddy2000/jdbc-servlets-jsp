	/*
	 * HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is indeed a stateless
	 * protocol. This means that each request from a client to a server is
	 * independent and doesn't rely on any previous requests. In other words, the
	 * server does not maintain any information about the client's state between
	 * requests.
	 * 
	 * Here's what stateless means in the context of HTTP:
	 * 
	 * 1. **No Memory of Past Requests**: When a client (such as a web browser)
	 * sends a request to a web server, the server processes the request and sends a
	 * response back to the client. Once this transaction is complete, the server
	 * forgets about the request and any data associated with it. It doesn't retain
	 * information about previous requests from the same client.
	 * 
	 * 2. **No Client-Side State**: HTTP doesn't inherently store any information on
	 * the client side (e.g., in a browser cookie or session). Each request from the
	 * client must contain all the necessary information for the server to
	 * understand and process the request, including any required authentication or
	 * session data.
	 * 
	 * 3. **State Management Techniques**: To work with stateless HTTP, web
	 * applications often use techniques like cookies, sessions, tokens, and other
	 * mechanisms to maintain user or application state. These techniques help
	 * establish a form of statefulness in an otherwise stateless protocol.
	 * 
	 * 4. **Scalability**: The statelessness of HTTP makes it easier to scale web
	 * applications because any server in a cluster can handle any request without
	 * needing to know about previous requests. This allows for load balancing and
	 * efficient resource allocation.
	 * 
	 * In contrast to HTTP, some other protocols and systems are stateful, meaning
	 * they maintain information about the state of a session or connection across
	 * multiple requests. HTTP's statelessness simplifies its design and makes it
	 * suitable for many different types of applications and scenarios, particularly
	 * those that benefit from a distributed and scalable architecture.
