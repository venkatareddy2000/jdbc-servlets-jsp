 * Servlet filters in Java provide a way to intercept and process requests and
 * responses in a web application. Filters allow you to perform various
 * pre-processing and post-processing tasks on incoming requests and outgoing
 * responses, such as logging, authentication, authorization, input validation,
 * character encoding, and more. They are a powerful mechanism for modularizing
 * and encapsulating common functionality that can be applied to multiple
 * servlets within an application. Here's an overview of servlet filters:
 * 
 * 1. **Filter Interface**: - Filters in Java implement the
 * `javax.servlet.Filter` interface. - This interface defines three methods:
 * `init()`, `doFilter()`, and `destroy()`. - The `init()` method is called when
 * the filter is first initialized. It can be used for one-time setup tasks. -
 * The `doFilter()` method is called for each request and response pair. It
 * contains the logic for processing the request and response. - The `destroy()`
 * method is called when the filter is being taken out of service and can be
 * used for cleanup.
 * 
 * 2. **Filter Chain**: - Multiple filters can be configured to work together in
 * a chain. - The order in which filters are executed can be specified in the
 * deployment descriptor (`web.xml`) or using annotations. - Each filter in the
 * chain can modify the request or response and pass it on to the next filter or
 * servlet in the chain.
 * 
 * 3. **Filter Mapping**: - Filters are mapped to specific URLs or servlets to
 * specify when they should be applied. - Mapping can be done using URL patterns
 * or by specifying the names of servlets to which the filter should be applied.
 * - Filters can also be mapped to apply to all requests by using the `"/*"`
 * pattern.
 * 
 * 4. **Filter Use Cases**: - Authentication and authorization: Ensuring that
 * only authorized users can access certain resources. - Input validation and
 * sanitization: Validating user input to prevent security vulnerabilities. -
 * Logging and auditing: Capturing information about requests and responses for
 * debugging or security auditing. - Character encoding: Ensuring that request
 * and response content is correctly encoded. - Compression: Compressing
 * response content to reduce bandwidth usage. - Caching: Implementing caching
 * strategies to improve performance. - Error handling: Handling exceptions and
 * errors gracefully.
 * 
 * Here's an example of a simple filter that logs information about incoming
 * requests:
 * 
 * ```java import java.io.IOException; import javax.servlet.Filter; import
 * javax.servlet.FilterChain; import javax.servlet.FilterConfig; import
 * javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.ServletRequest; import
 * javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
 * 
 * public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {
 * 
 * @Override public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException
 * { // Initialization code (if needed) }
 * 
 * @Override public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse
 * response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException { //
 * Pre-processing: Log information about the request
 * System.out.println("Request received from " + request.getRemoteAddr());
 * 
 * // Continue the request/response chain chain.doFilter(request, response);
 * 
 * // Post-processing: Log information about the response (if needed)
 * System.out.println("Response sent to " + request.getRemoteAddr()); }
 * 
 * @Override public void destroy() { // Cleanup code (if needed) } } ```
 * 
 * To use a filter, you need to configure it in the `web.xml` deployment
 * descriptor or use annotations, and map it to specific servlets or URL
 * patterns. Filters offer a versatile way to implement cross-cutting concerns
 * in web applications and can greatly enhance the modularity and
 * maintainability of your code.
