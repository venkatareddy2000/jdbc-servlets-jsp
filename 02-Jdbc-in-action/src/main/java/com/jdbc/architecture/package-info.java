/*
 * JDBC, which stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java-based framework
 * and API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java applications to
 * interact with relational databases. It provides a standard way for Java
 * applications to connect to, retrieve data from, and manipulate data within
 * relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more. JDBC follows a
 * layered architecture, and its key components include:
 * 
 * 1. **JDBC API**: The JDBC API consists of a set of classes and interfaces
 * provided by Java to interact with databases. It is part of the Java Standard
 * Library and is included in the `java.sql` package. The key interfaces in the
 * JDBC API include `Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`, and `DataSource`.
 * 
 * 2. **JDBC Drivers**: JDBC drivers are platform-specific implementations that
 * enable Java applications to communicate with a particular database system.
 * There are four types of JDBC drivers:
 * 
 * - **Type-1 Driver (JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver)**: This driver uses the ODBC
 * (Open Database Connectivity) API to communicate with databases. It is
 * platform-dependent and relatively less common today.
 * 
 * - **Type-2 Driver (Native-API Driver)**: This driver uses a database-specific
 * API to communicate directly with the database server. It is also
 * platform-dependent and can offer better performance than the Type-1 driver.
 * 
 * - **Type-3 Driver (Network Protocol Driver)**: This driver uses a middleware
 * server to translate JDBC calls into a database-specific protocol. It is
 * platform-independent and provides a higher level of abstraction.
 * 
 * - **Type-4 Driver (Thin Driver or Direct-to-Database Driver)**: This driver
 * communicates directly with the database server using a database-specific
 * protocol. It is platform-independent and is often considered the most
 * efficient option.
 * 
 * 3. **Connection Pooling**: JDBC applications often use connection pooling to
 * manage database connections efficiently. Connection pooling allows you to
 * reuse existing database connections rather than creating a new connection
 * every time a request is made. Popular connection pool libraries include
 * Apache DBCP and HikariCP.
 * 
 * 4. **Data Sources**: Data sources are objects that provide a way to manage
 * database connections and other resources in a standardized manner. The
 * `javax.sql.DataSource` interface is commonly used to manage data sources.
 * Data sources can be configured in application servers or through external
 * configuration files.
 * 
 * 5. **Statement and ResultSet**: The `Statement` interface is used to execute
 * SQL queries and updates. It comes in different flavors, such as `Statement`,
 * `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`. `ResultSet` is an interface
 * that represents the result set of a database query, allowing you to retrieve
 * and manipulate the data returned by the query.
 * 
 * 6. **Exception Handling**: JDBC handles database-related exceptions through
 * the `java.sql.SQLException` class. Proper exception handling is essential to
 * manage errors that may occur during database operations.
 * 
 * 7. **Transaction Management**: JDBC provides methods to manage database
 * transactions, allowing you to group multiple database operations into a
 * single transaction. You can control transactions using the `Connection`
 * interface's methods like `commit()` and `rollback()`.
 * 
 * 8. **Batch Processing**: JDBC supports batch processing, allowing you to
 * group multiple SQL statements together and execute them as a batch for
 * improved performance.
 * 
 * In summary, the JDBC architecture consists of a set of APIs, drivers, and
 * components that enable Java applications to interact with relational
 * databases. It provides a standardized way to connect to databases, execute
 * SQL queries, manage transactions, and handle database-related operations.
